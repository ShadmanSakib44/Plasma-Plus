## About The Project 
The Plasma Plus website is a platform that connects blood donors with individuals in need of blood transfusions. It allows registered users to browse available blood donation opportunities, sign up to donate and search for blood . 

To build the website, we used a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. HTML and CSS were used for the layout and styling of the website, while JavaScript was used to add interactivity and enhance the user experience. PHP and MySQL were used to create the backend of the website, allowing us to store and retrieve data from a database.

Our goal with Plasma Plus was to create a user-friendly and accessible platform that makes it easy for people to find and sign up for blood donation opportunities in their area. We hope that our website will help to increase the number of blood donations and ultimately save lives.
